        <img src="images/profile.jpeg" alt="Hello, my name is Brandon Chinchilla" width="200">
        <p>Hello! My name is Brandon Chinchilla Corleto, and I am a student in the WDD 130 course I love music and
            coding, I don't like webdevelopment mainly because of CSS and graphic design, Im not good at it thats why
            I'm reviewing this information again. I've struggled with some time managment issues and the overall stress
            of taking the class again, however I think this week has been very helpful in the fact that i have noticed
            that I'm doing better, I came to the conclusion that I only need to practice again and everything that I do
            will improve over time. My main priority is to increase the time that I sepnt with god and doing everything
            I can to get back on track with going to the Temple on Saturdays, its been difficult but I have come to the
            conclusion that my week is way better when I go, maybe at the beggining I was not going because I felt tired
            and not willing to go, because I have to take the bus and wake up really early in the morning but now that
            I'm trying to wake up earlier I came to realize that it is better for me to wake up early, I also thing
            about working out, I cannot wake up early yet, but I'm working on it, I set an alarm for 6 AM and I'm trying
            to go to bed at 10 PM</p>

        <p>
            I am from Guatemala, a small country in Central America, known for its beautiful landscapes, rich culture,
            and ancient Mayan ruins. Guatemala is home to the famous Tikal, one of the largest archaeological sites of
            the
            pre-Columbian Maya civilization. The country boasts diverse geography, including volcanoes, mountains, and
            tropical rainforests. Guatemala's vibrant culture is reflected in its traditional clothing, music, and
            festivals. The country is also known for its delicious cuisine, which includes dishes like tamales, pepian,
            and kak'ik. Despite facing challenges such as poverty and political instability, Guatemala remains a country
            with a strong sense of community and resilience.
